# Dflect
First Google Play Store app.


This app is a take on on the Black Mirror Episode "Nosedive" in which people are rated via an app on their phone. This rating is the rule all when it comes to who you are, and everyone you interact with. The higher your score on the app, the better you are percieved and essentially the btter life you will have, everything from work, to friends, and the things you buy all reflect your score.

Dflect will be just that, an app to rate others. Though in the show, their app seemed to be a social network of sorts where people rate pictures like instagram, my app will be more focused on the rating portion.
