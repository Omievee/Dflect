# Efkt.
First Google Play Store app.


This app is a take on on the Black Mirror Episode "Nosedive" in which people are rated via an app on their phone. This rating is the rule all when it comes to who you are, and everyone you interact with. The higher your score on the app, the better you are percieved and essentially the better life you will have, everything from work, to friends, and the things you buy all reflect your score.


Changed name to Efkt.

Efkt. is an app that allows you to rate your peers based on 5 main attributes, Friendliness, Engagement, Prefessionalism, Presentation, and Politeness. In my research, these 5 attributes were found to be the most common that people mentioned they noticed about someone when they first met them. The app isn't meant for a quick passerby, or for the friends you know very well already, it's for meeting new people and rating them based off of their experience. The more you use the app, and the better scores you recieve the better someone will be able to guage who you are, your Efkt on others essentially.

That guy you met at the networking event, or the group of people you met at a colleagues house warming, even the new person at work, all have an effect on you and everyone else. Being able to tell what kind of person they are based off of these 5 attributes will give you better insight as to who they are. 

The App links to your Gmail account, once logged in you can search for other users via email & send a rating. Once you find the person you want to rate, you select from the drop list which attribute you would like to rate them on & click the FAB to send your rating. Your rating is immediately sent to them & updated in the database. Likewise, when you recieve a rating, you can see it in the My Info section of the app, in real time. Your attribute scores directly affectd your Overall score, so the better you do in those, the high your overall will be.
